# ContextualCards
Developed a standalone container, that displays a list of Contextual Cards which refers to any view that is rendered using response fetched from an API.

These views are dynamic and their properties like images, color, texts, buttons (CTAs), etc. can be changed from the backend at any time.
This project has been developed for an assignment given by the FamPay team.
